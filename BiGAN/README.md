# My implimentation of Bidirectional Generative Adversarial Networks (BiGANs)

This code is based on an article by Jeff Donahue called Adversarial Feature Learning. 
https://arxiv.org/abs/1605.09782

The code also follows the Alec Radford's DCGAN setup.

I have added consensus optimisation (http://arxiv.org/abs/1705.10461) and instance noise (https://arxiv.org/abs/1701.04862) to assist
in training the model. 

I used MNIST.
