# My implimentation of Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN)

This code is based on an article by Ian J. Goodfellow called Generative Adversarial Networks.
https://arxiv.org/abs/1406.2661

I have added consensus optimisation (http://arxiv.org/abs/1705.10461) and instance noise (https://arxiv.org/abs/1701.04862) to assist
in training the model. 

The code is attempting to model a Gaussian distribution

I am constently updating this code. I love tweaking!
