# My implimentation of Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Networks (DCGANs)

This code is based on an article by Alec Radford called 
Unsupervised Representation Learning with Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Networks 
https://arxiv.org/abs/1511.06434

I have added consensus optimisation (http://arxiv.org/abs/1705.10461) and instance noise (https://arxiv.org/abs/1701.04862) to assist
in training the model.

The chosen dataset is MNIST.
