# Machine Learning Implementations

All code is writen for TensorFlow on ubuntu 16.04.

All of the code is towards designing an anomaly detection system. The model is to be unsupervised or semi-supervised.

At the moment I am exploring with Generative models. The idea is to model the distribution of 'healthy' data, and then 
see if the Generative model can pick up 'unhealthy' data - as this should deviate from the learned distribution.
